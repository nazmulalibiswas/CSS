### **Advanced Topic for CSS: 

 **CSS Pseudo-Classes**:
    
    The pseudo-class selector in CSS is used to select the element that is in a specific state.

    <h1>Syntax:</h1>

    selector: pseudo-class{

     property: value;

    }
    
    There are many pseudo-classes, but the ones that are commonly used are:
    
    #CSS Pseudo-Classes_example_1:
    ":hover" pseudo-class
    This pseudo-class is used to add a special effect to an element when our mouse pointer is over it. 


    #CSS Pseudo-Classes_example_2:
    ":active" pseudo-class
    The :active pseudo-class represents an element that the user has activated either by a pointing device or by a touchscreen device.
